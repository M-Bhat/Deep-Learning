### Deep Learning Project
# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
In this academic project, I have built a convolutional neural network model using Tensorflow, and Keras Python libraries. I trained this model using thousands of images of dogs and cats that are present in the dataset folder and then successfully predicted whether a single image was a cat or a dog.

# Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
In this project, I built an ANN using Tensorflow and Keras libraries. Then, I used the Churn Modeling dataset, (which contains details of bank customers) to train this ANN model. Before training the model, the dataset was first preprocessed using the LabelEncoder module from the Sklearn library to encode the 'gender' category data, and then I used OneHotEncoder to encode the 'country' categorical data. Then I used my ANN model to predict whether a particular customer would stay with the bank or not.
